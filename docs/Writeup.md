#### Intro
Hi Josh, here is your test assignment.

### React Application with Smile Detection

#### Objective
Develop a small React application that communicates with a Python backend service to display an image with a detected smile.

#### Requirements
- User Interface
    - Implement a button to start and stop the image capturing process.
    - Ensure the UI updates at least once per second.
    - Display the captured image on the left half of the screen.
    - Show the coordinates of the detected smile on the right half of the screen.

- Backend Integration
    - Use a Python backend to acquire the image.
    - Add a rectangle around the detected smile on the face.
    - Store successfully detected smiles in files.
    - Persist information about detection events in a database.

- Miscellaneous
    - Application should not use external services (like Google API). 
        - It is fine to use libraries (opencv is OK). 
    - Make sure your final result has some tests and instructions.
    
- Additional verbal requirements
    - Database migrations
    - Modern Python packaging
    - Write up how to run app
    - linting

#### Conclusion
If you did Angular in the past it will not take too much time to learn React. Basic rendering and hooks is all you need.

Please, let me know how much time do you think it will take.
