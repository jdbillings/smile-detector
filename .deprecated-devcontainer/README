MacOS doesn't make cameras (and other device drivers) available via /dev on the filesystem.
The webcam in particular needs to be accessed either via QTKit or via AVFoundation.

If drivers for the MBP retina camera are available for Linux, then a Linux VM (or dual-booting) might work...
Unclear if WSL has access to /dev/video0 for that matter...
