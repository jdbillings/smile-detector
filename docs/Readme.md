## Todos

- TODO: more manual testing of react async edge cases 
    -  in particular, webcam didn't always turn off when closing session? but I may have fixed that bug already
    -  With logging now: clear that I did NOT fix that bug. there's an issue where the videoFeed seems to operate independently of open/closeSession()
